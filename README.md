# Traffic Light Simulator
Developed a traffic simulator in Clojure to handle multiple intersections (crossings) independently, leveraging the advantages of parallel programming and data immutability.
Designed immutable data structures to represent crossings, traffic lights, and lanes, enabling efficient and secure access to the information required for the simulation.
Implemented an automaton to control traffic light cycles, optimizing wait times and improving safety at intersections. The complete cycle lasts 130 seconds, with clear transitions between states.
